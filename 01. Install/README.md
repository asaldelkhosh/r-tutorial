# Install

Download R sdk for Windows from this [link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).

As it is a Windows installer (.exe) with a name "R-version-win.exe". You can just double click and run the installer accepting the default settings. If your Windows is 32-bit version, it installs the 32-bit version. But if your windows is 64-bit, then it installs both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

After installation you can locate the icon to run the Program in a directory structure "R\R3.2.2\bin\i386\Rgui.exe" under the Windows Program Files. Clicking this icon brings up the R-GUI which is the R console to do R Programming.

## Add to environment variables
Go inside the directory where you downloaded the R sdk. Enter the bin directory and copy the full address.
Now go to your system variables path and add this path.
